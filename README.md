# Instructions

*personal project*

This is a repository for instructions on using various computer science/software development tools, programs, technologies, and concepts for those days (moments) in which brains say "Uhhh..." the intent is not necessarily to have fully articulated documentation on these resources but to have links to broader documentation and snippets of important information that has a high propensity to be forgotten.
